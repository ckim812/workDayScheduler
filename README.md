# workDayScheduler

## Description

```
The goal of this project is to create a work day scheduler that has time blocks with colors based upon current time. In this application, the user will be able to enter a custom event in each time block and save it so that it can be accessed at a later time.
```

## User Story

```md
AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule

WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock
